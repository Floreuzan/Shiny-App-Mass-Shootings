# Data

`Mass Shootings in America` is the focus of the Stanford Mass Shootings of America (MSA) data project that began in 2012, in reaction to the mass shooting in Sandy Hook, CT. The dataset contains a non-exhaustive list of US Mass Shootings from 1966 to 2016. The definition of mass shooting used for the Stanford database is 3 or more shooting victims (not necessarily fatalities), not including the shooter. The shooting must not be identifiable gang, drug, or organized crime related.

# Visualization

<li> </li>
<li> The Shiny_App_1 and Shiny_App 2 attempt to identify the profile of the shooter and their personal motivation. The profile of the shooter is defined by its age, its sex, its race, if they have military experience and any history of mental illness. 
<li> The first shiny app gives the bar charts of the type of place and the possible motivation by shooter’s profile. The barmcharts can either be in group or stacked barmode. </li>

<li> The second shiny app gives the bar charts of the type of place and the possible motivation by shooter’s profile. The barmcharts can either be in group or stacked barmode. </li>

<li>The dumbell plots is displayed with a Shiny App. You can choose a sector (Employment, Education, Entrepreneurship) with the radio button. Below, the dropdown menu will filter the categories included in the sector chosen. When choosing a category, the dumbell plot displays the value for the women (red) and men (blue) for each country of the year selected. It automatically orders the countries by decreasing order of the absolute value of the gender inequality gaps and filter for missing values for each year. You can also drag the date slider to view data at different points or click Play to see the date change automatically.</li>

<li>GII dsiplays the Gender Inequality Index from the Human Development Report for a selection of countries using Plotly. You can hover over the points to view a tooltip showing the Year, the Country and the GII value. </li>

<li>GPD_per_Capita_and_Wage_Gap is a shiny app showing the Gender inequalities by level of GPD (Gross Domestic Product) and by gender wage gap percentile. You can choose the level of percentile in the dropdown menu and the income level with the checkbox.</li>

<li>US_gender_wage_gap_by_age dsiplays the ratio of female-to-male median earnings by age in the US using Plotly. You can hover over the points to view a tooltip showing the Year, the Country and the ratio value. </li>


# Conclusions

<li> California has the strictest firearm laws in the nation but also the highest number of mass shooting incidents, but if we also consider the population of the state, the number of mass shooting deaths per population in California is not that high. </li>

<li> Semi-Automatic handguns have been involved in mass shootings, and if we ignore spree kills, more people die from semi-automatic handguns - especially in FMS or family murder suicides. </li>

<li> The profile of the murderer is a White Male around 31 years with history of mental illness and with military experience. The main motivation is after a dispute, which mostly occur in a residential area. </li>
